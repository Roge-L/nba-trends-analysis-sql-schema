# nba-trends-analysis-sql-schema

We created a SQL schema for an analysis on popular NBA trends while explaining design decisions and the data cleanup process.

## Investigation Questions

- Have players gotten better at shooting 3s? How has shot selection changed over the years?
- Are offenses truly more efficient nowadays? How much have point scored per game changed? Are players scoring more points per shot attempt? Are teams playing with faster pace in terms of number of possessions per game?
- Are more fouls being called? Has it become easier for players to draw free throws?

## Next Steps

After designing and implementing the SQL schema we move on to working with the schema and data in Python to find insights to answer our investigation questions [here](https://github.com/Roge-L/343-a2/tree/main).
